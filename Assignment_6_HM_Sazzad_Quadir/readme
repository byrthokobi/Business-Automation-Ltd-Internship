# Basic PHP E-commerce System

This is a basic e-commerce system built using PHP with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. User data and product information are stored in JSON files, and session storage is used to maintain cart and user authentication states.

## Features

- **Product Browsing**: Users can browse a list of products loaded from a JSON file.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to a shopping cart, view the cart, and remove items from it.
- **Checkout Process**: Users can proceed to checkout, where they can view the final cart and complete their purchase.
- **User Authentication**: Users can log in and log out. Authentication is handled by checking credentials stored in a JSON file.
- **No Database Required**: All data is stored in JSON files, making the setup simple and easy to manage.

The second task was about Version Controlling with Git. In this assignment, I had to:

- Create a Github account.
- Create a public repository in Github.
- Initialize git in your project.
- Create a branch using your first name.
- Push your code in the branch.
- Merge the branch with main branch of the repository.
- Upload your First Class Assignment  code in the repository.
- Lastly, I had to write 15 git commands and briefly discuss their use cases and upload the pdf file in a given form.
